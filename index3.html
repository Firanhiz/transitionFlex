                     A bicycle is a means of transportation. It is a two-wheeled vehicle.
                     It runs on the land. The bicycle is mainly made of iron. 
                     The main parts of a bicycle are the frame, the rims, the handle,
                     and the pedals. There is a leather seat to sit on. 
                     There are two pedals to move the cycle. A bell is fitted to the 
                     handle. A cycle has a carrier to carry men or things. There are two
                     brakes to control the speed.
